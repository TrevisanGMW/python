________________________________________
    Requirements:
pygame:
https://www.pygame.org/news
pip install pygame
________________________________________
    Description:
"pygame" was used so I wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel, plus it gave me a visual representation of what I was doing, which helped me test and understand if it was working.
If you don't want to see a GUI, simply change the variable "render_gui" to False. It can be found in the first lines of this file under "Basic Variables"
To print out the statistics for the random sample points, press SPACE BAR when using the pygame window. 
Statistics will be automatically printed when not using the GUI. ("render_gui" set to False)

This is certainly not the best implementation as the time complexity is not friendly to large inputs. 
I've optimized it a little by distributing the shapes into cells (render buckets), but due to time constraints I won't attempt to implement a different approach.
Probably a ray marching solution would have reduced the collision check times quite significantly.

________________________________________
    Requirements:
You have a rectangular 2d area, 1000.0 x 1000.0 float units. 
You need to populate it with 1000 shapes, randomly selected from 3 types rectangle, circle, diamond (diamond is symmetrical around the X and Y axis). 
Each shape is assigned an integer ID upon creation. 
Their sizes and positions are also selected randomly, with the following restrictions their maximum dimension should not be smaller than 10x10 units or larger than 100x100 units. 
They should be randomly but uniformly distributed inside our 1000x1000 area and not touch or cross its boundaries. 

Once itâ€™s done, we need to generate 1000 random point samples within the area and test which shape(s) each of them hits. 
A point can hit more than one shape. 
Print out the statistics how many of the 1000 shapes have been hit in total, and the median hit rate (shape hits per point sample).
